          <li>Enter your JavaScript notes here.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>To declare a variable, var uniquename with = assigment operator to assign the specific datat taht we want stored in our variable.</li>
          <li>A string are a sequence of character/values written within quatation marks "string,.." that incldues all the variables you declared. </li>
          <li>Once you list the string, by refering to var will let you access to your strings.</li>
            <li>var topics = "HTML", "CSS", "Git", "JavaScript";</li>
          <li>A console.log method will let you see this var action by adding an argument to output a message to the web console.</li>
          <li>A word console refers to a test environment that developers use to check out their code.</li>
          <li>A .log() method is a set of instructions for computer to execute.</li>
            <li>console.log(topics); is a command to check if the computer can execute your codes?!</li>
          <li>Link script.js to index.html like you linked the stylesheet style.css to index.html.</li>
            <li>to add stylesheet style css to index.html, we added link element inside the head element 
              link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css" </li>
            <li>But, to add JavaScript script.js is linked inside the body element after footer and before closing /body element. 
              <script> src="./assets/script.js"> </script> </li>
          <li>Use Chrome DevTools to view console.log output. 
                First open the index.html file by right-clicking "Open with Live Server"
                Then, right-click the page/brower and select "Inspect" and check its console tab for output.
                    or use shortcut command+shift+I
          </li>
          <li>A control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script, running top to bottom.</li>
          <li>Be intentional about the order/how we set up cod ein a JS file.</li>
          <li>Ways to control the order/flow, we can use conditional statements and for loops.</li>
          <li>A conditional statment is JS focus on the if statements. 
                If statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code.
                Using If to only excute if the statemetn meets the condition or it is true.
                
                       if (condition) {
                            // block of code to be excuted if condtion is truthy
                          } else if (2nd condition) {
                            // block of code
                          }
                          falsy value if it is one of following values: 0, -0, on, "", null, undefined, NaN or a Boolean data typed false value. 
                          truthy value if all other values, including a boolean data typed with true value.
          </li>
          <li>An array is a way to store a group of related data in a variable.
                An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. ie. shape var = ["various shapes", "or other types of data such as strings, numbers,"];
                An index is a location number of the data item to the order writtein in the array for identification, starting with 0.
          </li>
          <li>A for loop is to perform a task on each piece of the data uisng just a few lines of code.</li>
            <li>Used with if conditional statement. 
              A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be excuted over an over.</li>
              The coputer will go through each of the item in the array until there are no more items left.
              To use the for loop, we need item index and array's length.
              for(var x = 0; x < shapes.length; x++) {
                // code block such as 
                console/log(shape[x]);
              }

          <li>Use /* before and */ after the block of code to comment out a statement, make the statemetn in active without deletinng it.</li>
          
          <li>A javascript function is a set of instructions that tells teh computer how to perform a certain task. 
            Compared to for loop, a function do not automatically execute when teh JavaSCript file is run. 
            Instead, you must call a function by name in order to execute it.
            A function makes teh code more easily reusable because we can call it as many times as we need. You can control the flow.
            A function groups the task into one and when you call a function, the computer executes all the necessary steps to complete the task.
            1. Define a function by function declaration, using function keyword and code block/ function body for instructions. 
              function name() {
                // code block
              }
            2. Call the function by writing the function name(); function name followed by paranthesis and semicolon.
          </li>
          <li>function listTopics vs selectTopics</li>
          <li>To randomize our selection, we need to use math.random() function, which will select a random number.</li>
                var topics = ['HTML', 'CSS', 'Git', 'JavaScript'];
                var randomTopic = topics[Math.floor(Math.random() * topics.length)];
                                  math.floor() and math.random() are both properties of JS's built-in math object that is used together to generate a randon number.
              
                function listTopics() {
                  for (var x = 0; x < topics.length; x++) {
                    console.log(topics[x]);
                    }
                 }            
                
                function selectTopics() {
                  if (randomTopic === 'HTML') {
                    console.log("Let's study HTML!");
                  } else if (randomTopic === 'CSS') {
                    console.log("Let's study CSS!");
                  } else if (randomTopic === 'Git') {
                    console.log("Let's study Git!");
                  } else if (randomTopic === 'JavaScript') {
                    console.log("Let's study JavaScript!");
                  } else {
                    console.log('Please try again!');
                  }
                 }
                 
                 console.log('Here are the topics we learned through Prework:');
                 listTopics();
                 console.log('Which topic should we study first?');
                 selectTopic();
                }
